Analysis of a real dataset on baby name popularity provided by the Social Security Administration. The data can be downloaded in zip format from:

http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/state/namesbystate.zip

We report on descriptive satistics as well as a few insights mined from a data set of state by state baby name counts from 1910 to 2014. We present the following descriptive statistics:

- The most popular male and female names of all time
- favorite gender-neutral names in 1945 and 2013
- Names with biggest decreae and increase in popularity since 1980

We extract the following insights from the dataset:

- Increase in pupularity of gender ambigious names
- Correlation in the increaed tendency in using gender-neutral names with landmark events leading the legalization of same-sex marriage
- Dimentionality reduction (***randomized PCA***) of the data, comments on first tow principle components and ***K-means*** clustering of the states.
